                <p>Sister Act might be one of the funniest movies in the world. And the music is awesome too. The story tells the story of casino singer Delores VanCartier (Whoopi), who witnesses her (married) mobster boyfriend, Vince, murder (off-screen) a ganster who supposedly leaked to the plolice. A chase ensues but Delores escapes the lounge and goes to the police, who hide her in a convent until she can witness in Vince's trial. In the convent, she sticks out like a sore thumb among the nuns and the strict Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Soon she finds a place she loves and she teaches the chior. But when the horrible chior turns into a toe-tapping sensation, Vince learns of Delores's location. Sister Act is appropriate for ages 11 and up. I strongly disagree with CommonSense's rating it 9 and up. The only violence is the off-screen murder, and Vince is shot in the arm by the police. But there is talk of Delores having an affair with Vince and there is language such as a**, d**n, and s**t. So, these things make it inappropriate of ages 11 and up, but those who can watch it will have a whole lot of hilarious fun when they do.</p>
